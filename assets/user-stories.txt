As a user:

    I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
        title
        url link
        description
        rating (1-5)

    I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app
        All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating

    I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view
        Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link

    I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

    I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
        Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)

    I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection

    (Extension feature - optional) I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list

function handleAddItemClicked() {
  //this function will be responsible for when a user wants to add a new bookmark item
}

function renderBookmarkList() {
  //this function will be responsible for rendering the bookmark list in the DOM
}

function handleDetailedClicked() {
  //this function will be responsible for when a user wants a detailed view of a bookmark item
}

function handleDeleteItemClicked() {
  //this function will be responsible for when a user wants to delete a bookmark item
}

function handleNewItemSubmit() {
  //this function will be responsible for validating a user's form inputs when they want to create an item
}

function handleFilterClicked() {
  //this function will be respobsible for when a user wants a filtered view of the bookmark items
}
